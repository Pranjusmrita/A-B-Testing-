# A/B Testing

### Project Motivation

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The agenda of this project is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Pre-requisites

Here, I am working with Python in Jupyter notebook. We would require installing Anaconda which comes handy with all the packages that I have used in this project. Following are the libraries that needs to be installed before getting started with the Jupyter notebook:

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib


### Project workflow

1. In this project I have taken into account data with respect to a e-commerce website to help the company predict if implementing a new page in the website will increase the number of user clicks. A keypoint here is to make sure that a user clicking the new page option may not necessarily mean that he/she is viewing it. 
2. Two groups have been taken into account: Control and Treatment whose users land on the old and new page respectively. 
3. I have analysed the data and interpreted the results through three different approaches: 
    1. #### Probability
    2. #### Hypothesis Testing
    3. #### Logistic Regression
